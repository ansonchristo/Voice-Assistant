Currently working on a Voice Assistant program that allows me to do multiple commands. So far, this program can open reddit (Desired topic), launch any applications using "launch", open any website using "open", word definition using the library "Wikipedia" from Python, and responding to what kind of events I have in the future using Google Calendar API.
