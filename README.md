Currently working on implementing a Google Translator to my Voice Assistant program. So far, this program can open reddit (Desired topic), launch any applications using "launch", open any website using "open", word definition using the library "Wikipedia" from Python, and responding to what kind of events I have in the future using Google Calendar API.
